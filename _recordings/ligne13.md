category: metro
status: normal
duration: 20"
description: Line 13 links the Saint-Denis suburb (one of Paris' supposed "no-go zones") in the North with Montrouge in the South, through the upscale 7th arrondissement. It is one of the most commonly hated lines along with 12 due to frequent overcrowding and technical issues. In the recording you can clearly make out stops that are equipped with external platform doors.

                <p> Sounds of Paris is a collection of recordings from places around the French capital. We try to cover landmarks of everyday Parisian life, such as the metro or popular meeting places. We focus on soundscapes and avoid recording any discernible conversation. </p>
                <p> In the future, we aim to provide live audio streams from around the city. If you've got a street-facing window and some internet bandwidth to spare, please contact us, and we will provide instructions and/or hardware for you.</p>
                <p class="small">All sounds are recorded using the Zoom H4n Pro, and are freely available for download and reuse. Streamed audio is 44.1kHz, 96kbps MP3 or VBR 7. Downloadable audio is 192kbps or VBR 2. This website was based on the Grayscale theme for Jekyll and hosted using Netlify.</p>

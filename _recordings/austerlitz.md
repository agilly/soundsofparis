title: Gare d'Austerlitz - Paris-Cahors 17h37
category: rail
status: normal
duration: 34"
description: The bulk of this recording features ambient sounds around the Austerlitz train station. The middle part captures passengers boarding for a Paris-Cahors train on platform 2. Although this sound is not endangered, the station was under extensive refurbishment at the time of the recording, which will likely cause the soundscape to change quite a bit in the future.

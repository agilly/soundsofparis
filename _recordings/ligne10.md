title: 	â“‚10 (Gare d'Austerlitz - Boulogne)
category: metro
status: endangered
duration: 46"
description: Line 10 is one of the few lines whose route almost never leaves Rive Gauche, the left bank of the Seine. It is a quiet East-West line that mostly links residential or upscale neigbourhoods. It is one of the few remaining lines that still uses MP-67 coaches (1967), which RATP has been phasing out since 2008. Of particular architectural interest is the beautiful Mirabeau station, where one of the platforms is raised 2 meters above the other.

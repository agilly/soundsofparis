description: Having been described as both the centre and the belly of Paris, the Halles-Saint-Eustache quarter and its successive renovations have been divisive among locals. It serves both a meeting point, a shopping mall, and a place of transit. It is also home to Europe's largest underground metro interchange, connecting eight metro and regional lines over 4 levels.

description: Metro Line 11 links the city centre with République, Belleville and the north-eastern suburb of Les Lilas. It is the last of the metro lines to feature the MP-59, the oldest model of tyre wheel coaches (1959). Despite its age, it has the highest cruise speed among all of Paris' locomotives. As part of a massive overhaul of the Parisian metro, the MP-59 is scheduled to be decomissioned in the coming years.
